"3.1 Data Pre-processing Data pre-processing consists of traffic segmentation, data cleaning,
length unification, and format conversion, realizing the transformation from raw traffic
to images and byte sequences."

"Traffic Segmentation: For each encrypted traffic Pcap file, the five-tuple
(source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, and transport protocol)
is used as the basis for traffic split. ... a session is selected as the split granularity
instead of flow. ... split into several sessions by SplitCap."

"Data Cleaning: The information that may bias the model should be randomized,
such as MAC address and IP address. Duplicate or empty sessions should be deleted."

"Length Unification: The session length is fixed to 784 bytes ... excess part will be
trimmed, the part smaller than the session length will be filled with zero."

"Format Conversion: Each byte in the session has a size between 0 and 255,
which corresponds to each pixel value of the gray scale image ... a session can be
converted into a 28×28×1 grayscale image."
